# Joplin Autotagging Plugin
A (work in progress) Joplin plugin which allows autotagging based on user defined words.

# Installing
To install a plugin press the Install Plugin button within the Plugins page of the Configuration screen and select the \*.jpl file. Alternatively you can copy the \*.jpl to your profile's plugins directory directory `~/.config/joplin-desktop/plugins` (This path might be different on your device - check at the top of the Options page in the Configuration screen). The plugin will be automatically loaded and executed when you restart the application. You may need to check Joplin is not minimizing to the system tray/notification area rather than fully closing.
